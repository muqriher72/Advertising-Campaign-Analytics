# Advertising Campaign Performance Analytics

The primary objective of marketing agencies is to maximize the return on investment (ROI) for the client's advertising campaigns. In this project, we determine whether Facebook or AdWords yields better results in terms of conversions, clicks, and overall cost-effectiveness. 
By identifying the most effective platform, the marketing agency can allocate resources more efficiently to optimize advertising strategies and yield better results for clients.

The project invovles the following technical concepts:
- Python: Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn
- Hypothesis Testing
- Regression Analysis
- A/B Testing
